Objective: To learn backend development with node.js

Steps Taken: 

1- Started with mysql.

2- Switched to sequelize

3- Switched to mongodb nosql and stayed on nosql.

4- I implemented common backend logic like authentication, authorization, validation..

5- Then I deployed it to heroku, using aws for image storage.

6- Then I decided to convert to REST api.

7- I selected to use VueJs.

Currently I am trying to convert whole project to REST+Vue application.

In this project amazon aws s3(simple storage service) is used to store images. Database server resides in mongodb atlas. Finally, code resides in heroku server.
